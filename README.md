## Data Sources

The schedules are available in `docs/mrt-6.json` (weekday), `docs/mrt-6-sat.json` (Saturday), and `docs/mrt-6-fri.json` (Friday). These JSON files were compiled through observation of arrival and departure times. There could be a Â±1 minute error margin in the provided times.

## File Structure

- `/docs/index.html` â€“ Main application page
- `/docs/journey.html` â€“ "What's New" page showing recent updates
- `/docs/script.js` â€“ JavaScript logic for the schedule
- `/docs/styles.css` â€“ Styling for the app
- `/docs/service-worker.js` â€“ Caching logic for offline access
- `/docs/manifest.webmanifest` â€“ Web app manifest for PWA functionality
- `/docs/mrt-6.json`, `/docs/mrt-6-sat.json`, `/docs/mrt-6-fri.json` â€“ Schedule data
- `/docs/icons/` â€“ App icons for PWA installation

## Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- A web browser

### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Owais5514/Dhaka-MRT-Timetable.git
   cd Dhaka-MRT-Timetable
   ```
2. Open `docs/index.html` in your web browser

### Deployment
1. Configure GitHub Pages to use the project root
2. On push to the main branch, the GitHub Action will update the "What's New" page
3. Install the PWA on your device for an app-like experience

## How the JavaScript Works

The `script.js` file powers the application with these key functions:

1. **Data Fetching:** Retrieves schedule data from JSON files based on the current day
2. **Station Dropdown:** Populates station options in correct geographical sequence
3. **Train Schedules:** Displays upcoming trains based on current time and selected station
4. **Live Clock:** Updates the displayed time every second (Bangladesh time)
5. **Dark Mode:** Toggles between light and dark themes
6. **Page View Counter:** Tracks and displays visit counts using local storage
7. **Menu Functionality:** Provides access to additional resources
