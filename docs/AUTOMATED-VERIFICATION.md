# Automated Verification System

## How It Works

The train time verification system is now fully automated and requires no manual setup or configuration. Here's how it works:

### User Experience
1. **Click on any train time** in Platform 1 or Platform 2
2. **Provide feedback** via the modal (✓ for correct, ✗ for incorrect with delay info)
3. **Immediate update** - Your feedback is applied locally right away
4. **Automatic sync** - Your verification is automatically shared with all users within minutes

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Automatic GitHub Actions
- When a user submits feedback, it triggers a GitHub Action automatically
- No authentication tokens or manual setup required
- The system uses GitHub's public repository dispatch API
- Updates are committed and pushed automatically to the `verified-times.json` file

#### 2. Real-time Sharing
- All user verifications are stored in a central `verified-times.json` file
- Users' browsers automatically check for updates every 5 minutes
- Cache-busting ensures the latest data is always loaded
- Verified times show with a ✓ symbol for all users

#### 3. Fallback System
- If the automated update fails, verifications are stored locally
- Users still see their own feedback immediately
- The system continues to work even if the central sync is temporarily unavailable

## For Developers

### Files Structure
```
docs/
├── verified-times.json          # Central storage for all verifications
├── script.js                    # Contains verification logic
├── index.html                   # UI for feedback modals
└── styles.css                   # Styling for verification features

.github/workflows/
└── update-verified-times.yml    # Automated update workflow
```

### Key Functions
- `loadVerifiedTimes()` - Loads latest verifications from server
- `saveVerifiedTimes()` - Triggers automated update via GitHub Actions
- `generateTimeId()` - Creates unique identifiers for train times
- `addTrainTimeClickListeners()` - Makes train times clickable

### Verification Data Format
```json
{
  "verified_times": {
    "Uttara-North-Platform-1-Southbound-06:00": {
      "timeId": "Uttara-North-Platform-1-Southbound-06:00",
      "station": "Uttara North",
      "platform": "Platform 1",
      "direction": "Southbound",
      "time": "06:00",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "delay": 0,
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "userAgent": "...",
      "source": "user-feedback"
    }
  },
  "last_updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "version": 1
}
```

## Benefits

### ✅ No Configuration Required
- Works out of the box for all users
- No tokens, passwords, or setup needed
- Automatically handles all updates

### ✅ Real-time Collaboration
- All users contribute to the same verification database
- Verified times are shared across the entire user base
- Community-driven accuracy improvements

### ✅ Robust & Reliable
- Automatic fallback to local storage if needed
- Cache-busting ensures fresh data
- Error handling for network issues

### ✅ Version Controlled
- All verifications are tracked in Git history
- Full audit trail of all changes
- Easy to review and debug if needed

## Monitoring

### GitHub Actions
- Check the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository to see automated updates
- Each verification creates a new commit with timestamp
- Failed updates are visible in the workflow logs

### Browser Console
- Open developer tools to see verification status messages
- Loading confirmations: "Loaded X verified times from server"
- Submit confirmations: "Verification submitted successfully"
- Error messages if something goes wrong

### Local Storage
- Fallback verifications stored in browser's localStorage
- Key: `pendingVerifications` for failed submissions
- Automatically retried when connection is restored

This system ensures that the MRT timetable becomes more accurate over time through community contributions, without requiring any technical knowledge from users.
