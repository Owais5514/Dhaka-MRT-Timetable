# Things to add
- from 8:30 am to 10:30 am, add a delay of +1 minute (from mirpur 11 station to mirpur 10), +2 minute (from karwan bazar to agargoan) and +3 minute (from bijoy sharani to motijheel station). Only trains in platform 1 are affected. Display the delays with red colour and do not modify the times in mrt-6.json files, just add them before displaying below platform 2 heading. delay-handler.js file should be used to implement these logics. make sure to include the delay minutes in brackets beside the time
