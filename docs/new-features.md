# Things to add
- from 3:30 pm to 6:20 pm, add a delay of +1 minute (from dhaka university station to shahbag station), +2 minute (from karwan bazar to bijoy sharani) and +3 minute (from agargoan to uttara north station). Only trains in platform 2 are affected. Display the delays with red colour and do not modify the times in mrt-6.json files, just add them before displaying below platform 2 heading. do not use script.js to handle these logics, create another .js file inside the docs folder to handle it
- in the dev menu, add four preset times 8:00, 10:00, 16:00 and 18:30. pressing these buttons will change the current time to the pressed button. also add a pause/resume button that will pause the clock or resume it
